                <h3>6 reasons to farm organic</h3>
                <p>Supprot for organic has never been stronger,Many farmers would like to transition to organic agriculture in theory, 
                    but in practice face a number of barriers...<br>
                    1. Support for organic has never been stronger:<br>
                       Many farmers would like to transition to organic agriculture in theory, but in practice face a 
                       number of barriers to transition. Among them, weed management, the cost of
                       transitioning, and the recordkeeping requirements are the most daunting, according to transitioning farmers.<br>
                    2. Consumer appetite for organic products is growing:<br>
                       Consumer demand for certified organic products emblazoned with the USDA’s seal has never been 
                       stronger. 3 out of 4 grocery stores now offer organic products, with organic produce 
                       representing the most popular category of organic food.<br>
                    3. Building soil health is an investment in the future:<br>
                       Healthy soil is the bedrock of all successful organic farms, contributing to crop health through nutrient cycling, 
                       pest management, and water regulation.<br>
                    4. Healthy ecosystems can manage themselves:<br>
                        Farmers who integrate sheep in their vineyards, for example, have realized reduced pest pressure, 
                        increased biodiversity, reduced need for irrigation, reduced fuel use, and other benefits through their unconventional methods.<br>
                    5. Grow healthier, nutritionally dense, flavorful food:<br>
                       On average, conventional farms apply 2-12+ synthetic pesticides to their crops, with the average serving of 
                       conventionally-grown leafy greens, peppers, tree fruits, berries, and grapes containing 3-4 pesticide residues. <br>
                    6. Create healthier working environments for farm workers and rural neighbors:<br>
                       Interestingly, some studies show that organic farm workers actually have better mental health outcomes than their 
                       conventional counterparts, meaning organic farms offer a more healthy atmosphere for workers both physically and mentally.

                <h3>All you need to know about Grape Farming in India</h3>
                <p>India is among the leading 10 countries in the world in the production of grapes. Mostly used in India as a table
                    fresh fruit, grapes are also used for making wines and raisins.<br>
                1.Table purpose varieties:<br>
                    Seeded – Cardinal, concord Emperor, Italia, Anab-e-Shahi, Cheema Sahebi, Kali sahebi, Rao Sahebi.
                    Seedless – Thompson seedless, flame seedless, Kishmish Chorni, Perlette, Arkavati.<br>
                2.Raisin purpose varieties:<br>
                    Thompson seedless, Manik Chaman, Sonaka, Black Corinth, Black Monukka, Arkavati, Dattier.<br>
                3.Wine varieties:<br>
                Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Bangalore Blue, Muscat, Blanc, Pinot Noir, Pinot Blanc, White Riesling, and Merlot.<br>
                
                <-To get the best grapes yield, the following factors should be taken care of -> <br>
                
                1.Soil: The ideal soil for grapes should be fertile with 6.5-8.5 pH, should not be alkaline and have medium water
                    holding capacity.<br>
                
                2.Climate: In India grapes are grown in sub-tropical, hot tropical and mild tropical climatic regions.<br>
                
                3.Season: Usually, planting is done from October to January. In regions where the monsoon is late, planting is also
                    done during June-July.<br>
                
                4.Spacing: Spacing for planting depends on soil type, variety and method of training. The distance between two rows
                    may be 2 – 3 m while distance between vines within a row will be half of that, accommodating vines from 2000 to 5000
                    per hectare.<br>
                
                5.Nutrients: Grapes need Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium, Sulphur, Iron, Manganese, Zinc, Copper
                    and Boron. It is recommended to test your soil for deficient nutrients and provide fertilisers accordingly.<br>
                
                6.Irrigation system: Drip irrigation is highly recommended as it efficiently meets the water requirement of the crop.<br>
                
                7.Weeds and disease management: It is necessary to use weedicides and pesticides to keep your crop away from weeds and
                    diseases.

                <h3>Cotton farming- The success story</h3>
                <p>Cotton is one of the most important crops in the Marathwada and Vidarbha region of Maharashtra. At a time when
                    most regions in the state were dealing with numerous farming related problems, one man stood against all odds, 
                    applied modern farming techniques and emerged as an inspiration for other farmers – Mr. Ingle<br>
                -The back-story:<br>
                Vijay was using the traditional methods of cotton farming and was getting an average produce. He
                realized the water supply could be one of the hindrances and drip irrigation might help him increase his produce.<br>
                
                -The challenge:<br>
                None of the farmers in and around his village had used drip irrigation for cotton. There was no way he
                could guarantee the success of drip irrigation. Was it worth the risk? Let’s find out.<br>
                
                -The implementation:<br>
                He purchased the required equipment and set up drip irrigation in his farm, sprawling across 14
                acres. He had to invest a considerable amount, but he was sure it would pay off.<br>
                
                -The result:<br>
                Drip irrigation allowed uniform growth of plants. In addition, it became easier to provide the necessary
                nutrients by using fertiliser through drip irrigation. The same year, he produced a whopping 35 quintals of cotton in
                his farm and set a benchmark for others to look up to. He was awarded Appasaheb Pawar Irrigation award for his
                innovative farming methods and achieving a feat unheard of in the region.<br>
                
                -Mr. Ingle also recommends using BT Cotton farming as the BT variety of cotton is more resistant to pests and yields a
                good produce as well.

                <h3>Turning to Innovation: The Impact of Machinery on Sustainable Farming</h3>
                <p>
                    ->The Evolution of Farming Equipment:<br>
                    Agricultural tools and methods have changed a lot over the years. In the past, farmers had to rely on manual work
                    and simple tools, which took a lot of time and effort. Now, advanced machines are speeding up these tasks, helping
                    farmers grow more food without using up too many resources. Automated tractors and smart irrigation systems are just
                    some examples. Robotics are also on the way. These tools save time and reduce waste, making agricultural processes
                    more efficient. This shift means farmers can get better crop yields without harming the land, showing the importance
                    of technology in the industry.<br>
                
                    ->Advancing Sustainable Farming with Machinery:<br>
                    Reliable equipment providers play a key role in helping farmers switch to eco-friendly methods. These providers make
                    sure that farmers get the tools they need to farm in ways that are good for the environment.<br>
                
                    For example, finding reliable used motors and other durable machines helps farmers save money while adopting
                    sustainable practices. Good equipment from trusted suppliers allows farmers to work more efficiently and reduce
                    costs. For many smaller operations, buying from these suppliers makes it possible to afford quality equipment,
                    supporting long-term sustainability goals without harming the environment.<br>
                
                    For controlled environment agriculture (CEA) operations, including greenhouses and vertical farms, sourcing the best
                    equipment suppliers can be a challenging endeavor. That’s why, at Agritecture, we’ve partnered with reputable
                    greenhouse and vertical farming equipment suppliers to help simplify this process. Our goal is to connect you with
                    trusted providers, so you can access top-tier equipment that enhances productivity, reduces waste, and supports
                    sustainable farming practices. Through these partnerships, we make it easy to compare options and get quotes,
                    empowering farmers and CEA businesses to choose the best tools for their unique needs.

                <h3>Organic Farming</h3>
                <p>
                    Let’s talk about organic farming. This is an agricultural system that utilizes green manure, compost, biological
                    pest control and crop rotation to produce crops, livestock and poultry. It’s a system that cultivates resources to
                    conserve biodiversity and support ecological balance. Some of the primary aspects of organic farming are to augment
                    the soil’s biological activity, enhance the fertility of the soil, and use green manure, cover crops, animal manure,
                    and soil rotation to disturb the habitation of pests and diseases. Synthetic chemical fertilizers, antibiotics,
                    herbicides or pesticides aren’t used in organic farming. The goal within organic farming is to manage agricultural
                    production in the best natural way. Organic farming contributes added protection to the soil which in turn is
                    crucial for exceptional productivity.<br>
                
                    Organic farming isn’t about increasing or maximizing a greater yield of productivity, but rather ensuring the
                    sustainable production of high quality healthy food while maintaining crop and livestock diversity and respecting
                    the environment. Organic farming contributes to energy conservation through making extensive use of direct solar
                    energy and saving other energy sources taken directly from the earth’s resources.<br>
                
                    Farmers in organic farming need new sustainable mechanization to help ease and reduce hard labour, relieve labour
                    shortages, improve agricultural productivity and timeliness of operations, advance the efficient use of resources,
                    boost market access, and assists in alleviating climate related hazards. According to a report from the World Bank,
                    demand for food will increase by 70% by 2050; at least $80 billion annual investments will be needed to meet this
                    demand.<br>
                
                    One way to provide for this need is to match organic farmers with the right retail investors. Retailers have
                    longstanding relationships with their customers which means they want to invest in farmers who can meet the supply
                    and demand of their customers.

                <h3>5 Mistakes Farmers Should Avoid While Applying Fertilisers</h3>
                <p>
                 Here are five basic mistakes farmers should watch out for to ensure a successful harvest of crops -><br>
                
                >Imbalanced Nutrition: <br>
                  Plants require balanced nutrition to grow to their full potential.This consists of at least 13
                  essential nutrients in different quantities. Farmers normally consider only NPK fertiliser application, ignoring the
                  importance of other essential nutrients and micronutrients. This often results in reduced yield and an average-quality
                  crop.<br>
                >Fertiliser application without soil testing:<br>
                  Soil testing is crucial before you choose/apply fertilisers. You can then
                  choose the right fertilisers based on the soil test report. It is essential to provide deficient nutrients through
                  fertilisers if you want a high yield.<br>
                >Too much fertiliser:<br>
                  A common assumption among farmers regarding fertiliser application is that a higher dose of
                  fertiliser will give a better yield, which is not true. Fertiliser overdose adversely affects the crop, soil, and
                  environment. Irreversible damage can be caused due to salinity build up or due to the toxicity of specific elements.
                  Wrong timing: Failing to apply the right fertiliser quantity at the right time is a common mistake that leads to reduced
                  yield and damaged crops.<br>
                >Incorrect fertiliser placements:<br>
                  Fertiliser placement is an integral part of efficient crop management. Correct placement often improves nutrient absorption
                  by plants, and consequently boosts yields. Inorganic fertilisers can be applied manually or with application equipment. 
                  When applied manually, it is essential to distribute the fertilisers uniformly. Application equipment needs proper adjustment 
                  to ensure uniform spreading. Broadcast fertilisers should be incorporated after application to enhance effectiveness and to
                  avoid evaporation. With banding or spot application, take care that no fertiliser is placed too close to either the seed or
                  the germinating plant, to avoid damage to the seedling or roots.
